# Enigma

## Functionality 3
- Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

## Object Oriented Programming 3
- Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics 3
- Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.


## Test Driven Development 3
- Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3 things are explicitly tested). Obvious edge cases are addressed. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater.

## Version Control
- A passing project will have a minimum of 30 commits, and uses a pull request workflow that includes related and logical functionality.
